        <h2>What is Poverty?</h2>
		<p>Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter. However, poverty is much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: â€œPoverty is the lack of being able to eat . Poverty is lack of shelter.Poverty is the condition in which individuals or groups lack the financial resources and access to basic necessities needed for a decent standard of living. These necessities often include food, clean water, shelter, healthcare, education, and clothing. Poverty can manifest in various forms, ranging from absolute poverty (where people lack the basic necessities to survive) to relative poverty (where people may have enough for survival but still struggle compared to others in their society).</p>
